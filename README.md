# Docker Bash Dialog
A bash dialog for docker projects.

### What does it do?
This will show the current containers from the project directory you are working form. It shows which containers are defined in the docker-compose.yml file and which of them are currently running. It also provides some options for starting, stopping and cleaning containers.

# Notice: in progress
Although the files are somewhat working, it's still in development.

## Installation
1. Simply clone this repo anywhere on your machine, and then run ```install.sh```

2. The installer will ask you where you'd want to store the files, and if you'd like an alias for simple usage.

#### Done, you're all set!
